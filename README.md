TransformX Labs: Web3 & AI Education Platform

TransformX Labs is a community-driven initiative dedicated to bridging the knowledge gap around Web3 and AI technologies in Northern Nigeria. With a population of over 54 million people, fewer than 10% are aware of what Web3 and AI are, so our mission is to make these technologies accessible to everyone.

Our Mission

We aim to: Educate the community: Through events, workshops, and seminars that introduce people to Web3, blockchain, and AI.
Empower the next generation: By visiting schools and engaging younger students, teaching them the fundamentals of AI and Web3.
Inspire innovation: Encouraging participants to explore the possibilities of these technologies in solving real-world challenges.


How We Do It: Organize public events to raise awareness about Web3 and AI.
Collaborate with schools to incorporate Web3 and AI education into their curriculum.
Provide accessible educational materials such as articles, videos, and workshops.
Join us as we work to create a more informed and tech-savvy community in Northern Nigeria!
